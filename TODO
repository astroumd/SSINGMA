Better use the github issue tracker for this where appropriate:


- mkgalcube
  - ccdfits and/or ccdsky need to write better FITS headers [peter via NEMO]
  - use a more functional form that has a (r0,v0) scaling, which can be fitted
    in the simulated observations. This way we have a way to measure how one
    particular science result depends on the array selection parameters.
  - flux scaling (to note here is that in NEMO the sum(I.dx.dy.dz) is conserved
    when you smooth, which is not how CASA does it.

- overal flexiblity missing?

  - cannot simulate at different FREQ, most at 115GHz now (there is now a freq= keyword)
    incenter= and inwidth= need to correctly maintain doppler range in galaxy cubes
  - single point mosaic
  - no polarization
  - no telescope/sky noise added yet, might need FREQ for this as well (see XLS tables)


- plots:
  - 2D UV density plot, similar to weight density in tp2vis
