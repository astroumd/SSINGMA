Better use the github issue tracker for this where appropriate:


- mkgalcube
  - ccdfits and/or ccdsky need to write better FITS headers [peter via NEMO]


- overal flexiblity missing?

  - cannot simulate at different FREQ, most at 115GHz now (there is now a freq= keyword)
    incenter= and inwidth= need to correctly maintain doppler range in galaxy cubes
  - single point mosaic
  - no polarization
  - no telescope/sky noise added yet, might need FREQ for this as well (see XLS tables)
