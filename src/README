Examples to get started:

NOTE: it is always assumed you have initialize the software using e.g.      execfile('ngvla.py')

##  a CASA simulation

   phasecenter = 'J2000 12:00:00 -30.00.00'
   importfits('skymodel.fits','skymodel.im')
   ng_alma('test1','skymodel.im',phasecenter=phasecenter,cfg=0,niter=0)
   ng_stats('test1/test1.aca.cycle5.ms')
   -> 
   ng_stats('test1/dirtymap.image')
   -> 5.3863743657385914 151.09485838224359 -511.6363525390625 767.088623046875 1187.755927170781 

Although this is not an ngVLA but an (ACA) ALMA simulation, it can be quickly done
because the ACA only has 10 antennas, and runs in about 2 mins.  The ng_stats is meant to
provide a regression test

ng_vla('test2','skymodel.im',phasecenter=phasecenter,cfg='SWcore',niter=0)


This was running up my memory to 2.8 GB, took 17 mins. to run. Note that this unrealistic field
is at DEC = -30
