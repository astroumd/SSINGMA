## Short Spacing Issues in Nearby Galaxy Mapping with the ngVLA

The second call for ngVLA commmunity award proposals, yielded a total of
[12 approved scientific studies](http://ngvla.nrao.edu/page/commstudiesprogram#CS2)

All ngVLA Community Studies are expected to:

* demonstrate the major scientific/technical advancement being advocated and put it in context for the broader astronomical community
* clearly state the impact on design choices
* produce a publication in a peer-refereed journal, or at minimum in the ngVLA memo series

All accepted Community Studies efforts from the second round are
expected to write up their findings as part of a peer-refereed journal
article or ngVLA memo, and present their progress/final results at the
["Astronomy Frontiers in the next Decade and Beyond"](http://go.nrao.edu/ngvla18)
Science Conference, June 26-29, 2018 in Portland, OR.  Consequently, NRAO is
financially supporting each study, at modest level, to offset travel
expenses to present results at the June Science Meeting, and offset
page charges from publications expected to result from the study.  As
with the first round of studies, the NRAO is supporting a number of
these at a much more significant level.
