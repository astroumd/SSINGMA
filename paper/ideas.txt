Various ramblings which can or can not go into the discussion in the paper 



Two ways to get a TP map:
  - simulating an OTF mapping (just a convolution with the TP beam,
    but it's not easy to get a TP beam [is it?], so just do a gaussian, which CASA can do)
    Otherwise use imconvol with the TP beam if you get them.
  - Take a (hex) grid of nyquist sampled pointings, and resample this into a TP map
    This is not straightforward and since we do OTF (right?) we dont' need to worry
